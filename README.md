## Project FAQ
#### 1. What is bookworm?
bookworm is a tool to help individuals manage personalized virtual bookshelf. 

#### 2. How does it work?
After creating an account, users can search for books to save to their collection.  Once a user's collection is populated, users have the ability to add comments to books, mark books as read/unread, and also remove books from their list. 

#### 3. What is the problem this product solves?
There is a need for a private platform to users to keep track of books and personal reviews without the noise of other users or advertisments. bookworm is free of distractions - the only content the user sees are books they have personally curated alongside user-created comments. bookworm is minimalistic, to the point, and user-focused.
